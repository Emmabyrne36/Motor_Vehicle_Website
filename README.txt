I was able to finish all parts of the assignment including styling and error handling.
Error handling is seen in each of my pages when it tries to access the database. It checks whether there is a connection and if not an error message prints out to that effect. 

Any code that I obtained from external sources is referenced in the code. Any code not referenced was obtained from the lectures or from my own knowledge.
The colour codes used were obtained from http://htmlcolorcodes.com/.
